# Theme "osmcarto"

This theme contains the definition for the OpenStreetMap Carto style from
https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto .

There is only one topic called `osmcarto` available. Use like this:

```{lua}
themepark:add_topic('osmcarto/osmcarto')
```

Note that this contains a [copy of the
config](topics/openstreetmap-carto-flex.lua) from the [openstreetmap-carto
repository](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto). If that file
is changed, it needs to be copied here.
